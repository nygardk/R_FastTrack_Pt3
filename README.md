## Problem definition

Find the largest sum along the route from the top of a tree to the bottom without
examining every possible path. The best path is the one with largest cumulative
sum from the nodes. Example tree:

        5
      14 23
     81 23 43
    43 51 33 10

where the largest sum would cumulate by route [5,14,81,51], thus resulting in
the best path.
